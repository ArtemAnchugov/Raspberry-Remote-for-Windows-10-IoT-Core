# Raspberry Remote for Windows 10 IoT Core

## About
Control your remote plugs with your Raspberry Pi running Windows 10 IoT Core.

The code of this project is based on the code from the Raspberry-Remote project (see https://github.com/xkonni/raspberry-remote).

Instead of using wiringPi (https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/) this project uses the Windows.Devices.Gpio interface
provided by Microsoft in the extension Windows IoT Extensions for the UWP.
